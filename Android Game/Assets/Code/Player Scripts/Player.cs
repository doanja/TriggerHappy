* This is the player class which handles the Player Object's physics, and controls of the player.
* The player has a set amount of health which can be decremented by another GameObject if they have
* the scripts necessary to deal damage to the Player Object. If the Player object's health reaches 
* zero, the Kill method will be invoked, and the player will respawn at the last acquired checkpoint. 
* This class has an instance of the Charactercontroller2D which overrides Unity's generic Physics.
* This allows the Player Object's parameters to be overriden by other classes that can affect how 
* the Player Object's physics react under certain conditions, such as terrain, and special effects
* caused by other GameObjects.
